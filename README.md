# Backend Lab (Hub for various Backend projects)

## Overview
This repository contains backend projects inspired by the ideas listed on  
[roadmap.sh – Backend Projects](https://roadmap.sh/projects?g=backend).
Alongside those project ideas, I’ve added my own custom concepts, improvements, and architectural experiments.  
The goal is to build a practical, hands‑on collection of backend implementations that grow in complexity over time.

## Sources of Project Ideas
- Project ideas from roadmap.sh’s backend section  
- Additional projects and ideas, extensions, and architectural experiments of my own

## Goals
- Implement backend projects from beginner to advanced
- Add custom features beyond the original project descriptions
- Explore clean architecture, modular design, and scalable backend patterns
- Document learnings, tradeoffs, and best practices along the way

## Tech Stack
- Go + Gin
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Additional backend tools and libraries as needed

## Structure
Each project lives in its own folder with:
- A clear description
- Implementation source code
